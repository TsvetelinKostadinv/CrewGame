##### General Overview
The aim of this game is to be an RTS game where you manage cities, trade routes, armies and much more while being able to employ different people(and not only people) to manage micro jobs for you. <br>
Another feature I wish to add is the open world nature of most RPGs. <br>
While this is a strategy game on a lower level it will also have many RPG elements like equipment for the workers you will employ.
